      tagline: A Documentary About Youtubers
      overview: Please Subscribe is an intimate look into the lives of YouTubers and answers the question that many family members and friends love to ask you. What is a YouTuber? This documentary was born out of my desire to be able to answer this question for myself. I've been making YouTube videos for years and yet there was something so much more to the community and the spirit of the content creators than I was able to explain. I brought this idea to the community and through their amazing support, I decided to interview and follow some of the site's top content creators to try to find what drives them, where they come from, and where they see themselves going.
